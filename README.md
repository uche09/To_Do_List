My first python project as a beginner; a Command Line Interface (CLI) To-Do list manager program that performs the following functionalities:

1. User registration and login.
2. Task management operations such as: adding task, deleting task, updating task and viewing tasks.
3. In-built task categorization (personal, work and school).
4. Notification for tasks with approaching deadlines.
5. Database.

This program is user-friendly and easy to navigate!
